## Portfolio blog

This readme serves as notes so I don't forget how it works

* Built using [Jekyll]|(https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme
* If on OS X: [Install rvm on OS X](https://usabilityetc.com/articles/ruby-on-mac-os-x-with-rvm/) (the install takes hours, this is "normal")
* Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
* Run the website: `jekyll serve`
