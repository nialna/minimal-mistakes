[Ready Chef Go](https://story.snapchat.com/games/ready-chef-go) is a Snapchat game about cooking in a restaurant with your friends. The gameplay is running around the kitchen picking up ingredients to make meals and serve them to customers, all in realtime multiplayer, and with an opposing kitchen team trying to score more points during the match by serving more dishes.

I joined the team near the end of production to help finish the game for global launch, then stayed on it to help make the next few patches. I mostly helped in the area of improving player control and game feel, and also metagame.

The game is made with the Playcanvas engine, and server written in golang.

The game launch was mentioned on [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/28/snap-rolls-out-ready-chef-go-mobile-messaging-game-globally/)
