Music Quiz Duel is a mobile Quiz game I made while working at Mangoo Games.

It is a pseudo-sequel to [Music Quiz](http://blog.lianapigeot.com/music-quiz/) but a lot more ambitious: Music Quiz Duel is a multiplayer game.

In the game, you play matches against random people (or Facebook friends) of 5 rounds. Each round is a music to guess, and the player gets a bigger score depending on how fast they find the answer.

There are leaderboards, a leveling system, and dynamic playlists that are added in the back end and players can buy.

The game makes heavy use of the Facebook graph APIs
