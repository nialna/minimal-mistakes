## BD Run

BD Run is a typing game on Facebook that I made with [Bigger Than Fiction](https://www.biggerthanfiction.com/). This game was made to promote french comic artist, in partnership with a french comics website.

The game is a "race" in a comic: There are comic strips with missing words that you have to type as fast as you can in five different courses (each a single comic wrote specifically for the game). Scores are then compared in a leaderboard on Facebook with friends etc. and there were prizes to win.
