## My Bio

I am Liana Pigeot, game developer since 2011. I studied game development at [Isart Digital](https://www.isart.com/en/) in Paris, while starting internships in game development at the same time.

## Skills
I've used a wide range of technologies depending on the projects, but I mostly focus on Unity, Unreal en HTML5, and am particularly interested in Virtual Reality currently. Other than that, I've used (in no particular order): Corona SDK, node.js, Facebook API, Monogame, native iOS, tvOS and watchOS, Android, Wii U NWF, Ouya, SteamVR.

Languages I know the most:

* Javascript
* C# (Unity)
* Ruby
* Lua

## Specialties
I particularly care about polish and adding details that make the player happy. Paying a lot of attention to UI/UX or animations is something I tend to do a lot, and I will often come up with ideas to improve the game's feel.

Another thing I do a lot is improving workflow. I frequently create tools or generally reusable code when I can identify something that is reptitive/painful for people in the team. This usually increases everyone's productivity so I try to do it whenever the occasion arises.

Currently open to offers, I am mainly looking for an offer on interesting game projects: PC/Console, VR, or mobile games with an interesting gameplay.
