title: "Hoshikaze 2250 board game"

A few years ago I worked with the association Hoshikaze 2250 which is an indie sci-fi crossmedia license, to create their board game.

We were a few artists and designers. I took part in creating the rules of the game and how everything works.

A simple way to describe it would be: Look at games like FTL. Basically, the players are in a ship in space, and need to complete a mission (transporting cargo from point A to B, or things of that kind).

During the trip, problems appear each turn (pirate attacks, pieces broken, sick crew member...) and players had to use their resources and move the crew around to fix things.
