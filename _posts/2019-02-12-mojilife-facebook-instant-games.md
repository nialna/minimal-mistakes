MojiLife is a game on Facebook instant games I developped at Mojiworks. It is a life simulator game where the player makes choices at the timeline of their life progresses, until eventually something causes their death and they start a new life with the opportunity of making different choices.

The game has a "traits" system in which different choices will increase or decrease various personality traits (for example: awkward, clever, introverted, arrogant...). Those traits are then used to influence which choices become available during the life and to generate flavour text related to what happened in the player's life.

The game is made in typescript using vue.js and vuex, the server is in node.js.

The game was soft launched on Facebook instant games but isn't live anymore.
