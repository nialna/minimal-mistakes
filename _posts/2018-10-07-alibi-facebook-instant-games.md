Alibi is a game for Facebook instant games I developped at Mojiworks. I was the main programmer on the team. The gameplay is to collaborate with your friend in an interrogation to "get your story straight" by giving the same answers. It is a personality test meant to make players learn more about each other by trying to guess what their friend would answer.

The game was soft launched on Facebook instant games but isn't live anymore.

The game is implemented in TypeScript with vue.js and vuex. The server is in node.js
